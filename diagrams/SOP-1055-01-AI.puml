' Define Participants
participant "System Owner" as SOWN
participant "AI-IRB Liaison" as IRB
participant "Security Compliance Manager" as SCM
participant "Development Team" as DEV
participant "Operations Manager" as OM
participant "Quality Assurance" as QA
participant "Project Manager" as PM
participant "Technical Support" as TS

' 1) Planning and Assessment
SOWN -> PM: Provide system scope details
PM -> IRB: Verify AI usage and ethical considerations
alt AI/ML requires special review
  IRB -> IRB: Coordinate extended ethics check
else No special review
  IRB -> IRB: Note standard AI compliance
end
SCM -> SCM: Conduct risk assessment (data integrity, confidentiality)
SCM -> SOWN: Deliver risk report for sign-off

' 2) Control Framework and Design
SCM -> SCM: Select control standards (ISO, NIST, AI-IRB guidelines)
OM -> SCM: Provide environment constraints for roles/privileges
SCM -> OM: Approve user roles and privileges
IRB -> SOWN: Review system controls for ethics/regulatory
SOWN -> IRB: Final sign-off on control design

' 3) Implementation of Controls
DEV -> DEV: Configure software modules per design
OM -> OM: Set up hardware security features (firewalls, network segments)
DEV -> QA: Commit code to version control, QA checks traceability
SCM -> SCM: Create user accounts, set policy (MFA, password rules)
SCM -> OM: Confirm logging & audit settings

' 4) Validation, Testing, and Monitoring
QA -> QA: Execute test cases on system controls
QA -> SCM: Log findings or security concerns
SCM -> SCM: Perform pen tests/vulnerability scans
IRB -> IRB: Confirm ethical compliance in system logging
QA -> DEV: Defect log if issues found
DEV -> QA: Resolve defects, retest until pass

' 5) Deployment and Change Control
PM -> SOWN: Request final go/no-go on deployment
SOWN -> PM: Approve deployment strategy
PM -> OM: Schedule and execute system deployment
OM -> QA: Verify final deployment environment is correct
QA -> PM: Final sign-off after verifying no unauthorized changes
note right
  If any new changes:
  Use formal Change Control
end note
PM -> TS: Provide system transition info for training and support

' 6) Documentation and Post-Implementation
QA -> PM: Compile final system control documentation
PM -> IRB: Submit compliance docs for AI-IRB records
OM -> OM: Monitor system health and logs
QA -> QA: Conduct post-implementation review
IRB -> IRB: Document any ethical/compliance lessons learned
