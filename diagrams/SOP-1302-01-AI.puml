title SOP-1302-01-AI: AI Explainability & Model Transparency

' Define participants (roles) with short names
participant "AI Gov Office" as GOV
participant "AI-IRB" as IRB
participant "Project Sponsor" as PS
participant "Data Sci/Eng" as DSC
participant "Quality Assurance" as QA
participant "Operations" as OPS
participant "Technical Support" as TS

' 1. GOV and DSC define the level of explainability needed
GOV -> DSC: Discuss project scope & define explainability level
DSC -> GOV: Provide technical feasibility & outline approach

' 2. IRB provides regulatory & ethical guidelines
GOV -> IRB: Request compliance guidelines
IRB -> GOV: Provide guidelines for transparency & interpretability

' 3. DSC documents requirements
DSC -> DSC: Document interpretability metrics & scope
DSC -> PS: Present resource needs for implementing explanation

' 4. DSC + IRB confirm approach meets or exceeds thresholds
DSC -> IRB: Submit proposed approach for interpretability
alt Approach accepted
  IRB -> DSC: Concur on approach
else Approach not accepted
  IRB -> DSC: Request modifications
  DSC -> DSC: Update approach & resubmit
end

' 5. DSC implements explanation mechanism
DSC -> DSC: Implement local/global explanation methods (LIME, SHAP, etc.)

' 6. QA verifies correctness & logs
DSC -> QA: Provide explanation outputs for internal testing
QA -> QA: Validate explanation consistency with model
alt Explanation insufficient
  QA -> DSC: Request fix or improvement
  DSC -> DSC: Revise approach
  QA -> QA: Retest
else Explanation sufficient
  QA -> DSC: Approve QA test results
end

' 7. DSC finalizes documentation
DSC -> DSC: Create user-friendly references for model interpretability

' 8. TS refines user-facing content
DSC -> TS: Deliver technical docs
TS -> TS: Convert docs for non-technical audiences

' 9. IRB & GOV sign-off on final documentation
TS -> IRB: Submit final interpretability docs
IRB -> GOV: Final compliance check
GOV -> TS: Approved to move forward

'10. OPS deploys model & explanation features
OPS -> OPS: Deploy code & explanation modules to staging/production

'11. Explanation usage is monitored
OPS -> GOV: Provide logs/metrics on explanation usage

'12. If anomalies arise, DSC investigates root cause
alt Explanation anomalies
  OPS -> DSC: Report contradictory interpretation logs
  DSC -> DSC: Investigate root cause & fix
  QA -> DSC: Validate the fix
end

'13. Post-Implementation Review
GOV -> TS: Gather user feedback on explanation clarity
TS -> GOV: Provide compiled feedback
GOV -> IRB: Discuss lessons learned
IRB -> DSC: Potential procedure updates if needed
