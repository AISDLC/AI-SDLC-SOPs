' 1. MLOps sets up automated monitoring
MLOps -> MLOps: Configure monitoring pipelines

' 2. Data Science Lead provides drift guidelines
DSL -> MLOps: Provide drift detection thresholds
note right
  The DSL defines performance
  thresholds for anomaly alerts.
end note

' 3. Ops ensures stable production environment
Ops -> Ops: Validate production environment stability

' 4. AI Dev Team runs periodic checks
Dev -> Dev: Execute performance checks

' 5. alt Performance within acceptable range
alt Performance is acceptable
  Dev -> Dev: Log metrics (no action needed)
else Performance drops below threshold
  Dev -> DSL: Trigger alert on performance shortfall
  DSL -> DSL: Review logs and performance data

  ' 6. alt Real issue found
  alt Real model drift/issue
    DSL -> Dev: Request retraining or refinements
    Dev -> Dev: Prepare new data/parameters

    ' 7. Developer updates code/pipelines
    Dev -> MLOps: Submit updated model for environment test

    ' 8. QA organizes test environment
    QA -> QA: Validate updated model in QA environment

    ' 9. IRB checks compliance if scope changed
    alt Changes alter scope
      IRB -> IRB: Evaluate compliance with new data usage
      IRB -> Legal: Notify for further guidance
      Legal -> IRB: Provide sign-off or request clarifications
    else No scope change

    ' 10. If approved, MLOps deploys new model
    MLOps -> Dev: New model passes QA
    Dev -> MLOps: Prepare final deployment to production
    MLOps -> MLOps: Redeploy with updated version

    ' 11. Technical Support is notified
    MLOps -> TS: Inform of new model changes

' 12. Post-implementation and ongoing maintenance
Dev -> QA: Provide performance dashboards
QA -> QA: Schedule periodic audits

' 13. alt Additional user complaints
alt New issues from end-users
  TS -> Dev: Escalate concerns to investigate
  Dev -> DSL: Evaluate & fix as needed
else No major user issues
  QA -> QA: Continue normal monitoring
end

' 14. Post-Implementation Review
QA -> IRB: Summarize compliance and ethical alignment
Dev -> QA: Lessons learned (model improvements)
DSL -> QA: Final sign-off on process outcomes
