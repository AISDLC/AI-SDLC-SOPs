' 4.1 Initiation of Explainability Requirements
ProductM -> AIDev: Identify need for AI explainability
AIDev -> DSL: Request advice on suitable explanation frameworks
DSL -> IRBLiaison: Present proposed approach for ethical/regulatory review
alt If concerns arise
  IRBLiaison -> DSL: Raise compliance/ethical concerns
  DSL -> AIDev: Revise approach to address concerns
else No major concerns
  IRBLiaison -> DSL: No critical issues found, proceed
end

' 4.2 Selecting Explanation Framework
DSL -> AIDev: Confirm global/local interpretability approach
AIDev -> AIDev: Implement or refine design plan
AIDev -> IRBLiaison: Provide final plan for sign-off
IRBLiaison -> AIDev: Approved approach

' 4.3 Model Implementation and Explanation Development
AIDev -> AIDev: Implement model & integrate explanation technique
AIDev -> QA: Provide code for review of explanation generation
QA -> AIDev: Feedback on potential issues
AIDev -> AIDev: Resolve any QA findings

' 4.4 Testing Explanation Capabilities
AIDev -> AIDev: Generate sample explanation outputs in staging
AIDev -> QA: Deliver test artifacts for validation
QA -> QA: Validate explanation correctness & traceability
alt If defects found
  QA -> AIDev: Log explanation defects
  AIDev -> AIDev: Fix and retest
end

' 4.5 User-Facing Documentation and Approvals
TechSup -> AIDev: Request doc clarifications for end-user understanding
AIDev -> TechSup: Provide final explanation docs & best practices
TechSup -> Legal: Provide user documentation for compliance check
Legal -> TechSup: Confirm compliance or request changes
SrMgmt -> TechSup: Final sign-off on interpretability readiness

' 4.6 Deployment and Monitoring
Ops -> AIDev: Deploy explanation code to production
AIDev -> TechSup: Confirm production environment explanation is active
TechSup -> TechSup: Prepare support channels for user queries
QA -> Ops: Monitor logs for explanation issues

' 4.7 Change Management for Explanation Methods
AIDev -> AIDev: Propose new or updated explanation method
AIDev -> IRBLiaison: Submit change request for ethical review
alt Approved
  IRBLiaison -> QA: Confirm no new compliance issues
  QA -> AIDev: Validate new method in staging
else Rejected
  IRBLiaison -> AIDev: Return request for revision
end

' 4.8 Post-Implementation Review
