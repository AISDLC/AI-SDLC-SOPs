' 1) Model Ideation & Requirements Gathering
BS -> DS: Provide Business Objectives & Constraints
DS -> PS: Present High-Level Feasibility
PS -> AIRB: Request Preliminary AI-IRB Ethical Check
AIRB -> DS: Provide Early Ethics Feedback

' 2) Data Collection & Preparation
DS -> DS: Ingest & Clean Data
DS -> DS: Label & Validate Data
DS -> AIRB: Confirm Data Compliance Requirements

' 3) Model Development
DS -> Dev: Request Code Setup & Version Control
Dev -> DS: Provide Development Environment
DS -> DS: Train Model(s), Tune Hyperparams
DS -> QA: Share Preliminary Model Results

' 4) Internal Validation & Testing
QA -> DS: Review Model Performance & Potential Bias
DS -> QA: Provide Model Interpretability Docs
QA -> DS: Request Additional Adjustments (if needed)

' 5) AI-IRB & External Approval
DS -> AIRB: Submit Full Documentation & Compliance
alt AI-IRB Approved?
    else Not Approved
      AIRB -> DS: Provide Revisions Required
      DS -> DS: Revise & Address Concerns
      DS -> AIRB: Resubmit for Approval
    end
AIRB -> PS: AI-IRB Officially Approved

' 6) Pre-Deployment Preparation
MLOps -> DS: Prepare Staging Environment
Dev -> MLOps: Merge Final Code for Deployment
QA -> MLOps: Validate Acceptance Tests in Staging
QA -> MO: Confirm readiness for Production

' 7) Deployment to Production
MO -> MLOps: Authorize Production Rollout
MLOps -> MLOps: Deploy Model & Infrastructure
MLOps -> Dev: Notify Deployment Completion
Dev -> BS: Production Release Announced

' 8) Post-Deployment Monitoring
MLOps -> DS: Send Performance & Drift Metrics
DS -> MO: Evaluate Model Behavior
alt If Performance Degrades
  DS -> DS: Trigger Retraining or Tuning
else If Performance Stable
  DS -> DS: Continue Monitoring
end

' 9) Periodic Retraining & Maintenance
DS -> MLOps: Schedule Automatic Retraining Jobs
Dev -> QA: Check Updated Model for Regressions
QA -> MO: Approve Updated Model for Re-Deployment

' 10) Model Retirement
MO -> DS: Initiate Retirement if Model is Obsolete
MLOps -> Dev: Archive Model Artifacts
AIRB -> MO: Verify Final Compliance Records
MO -> All: Confirm Model Retired & Document Lessons
