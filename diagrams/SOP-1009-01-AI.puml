' Step 4.1: Monitoring and Drift Detection
DS -> DS: Monitor model performance
DS -> DS: Detect anomaly or threshold breach
DS -> DS: Classify Trigger Event (drift/bias/data shift)

' Step 4.2: Initiate Drift Evaluation
DS -> PM: Notify potential drift
PM -> BO: Inform about drift event
PM -> QA: Request quick assessment
PM -> OPS: Request environment/log analysis
PM -> SC: Check compliance or security concerns

alt Ethical/Regulatory Concern
  PM -> IRB: Notify AI-IRB for oversight
else No Ethical Concern
  note over PM,DS: IRB not involved
end

' Step 4.3: Approve Re-Validation Plan
DS -> DS: Draft Re-Validation Plan
DS -> PM: Submit Re-Validation Plan
PM -> BO: Request approval
PM -> QA: Request feedback
PM -> OPS: Request environment feasibility
PM -> SC: Request compliance feedback
alt Plan Approved
  BO -> PM: Approve Plan
else Plan Revisions
  BO -> DS: Request changes
  DS -> DS: Update Plan
  DS -> PM: Resubmit
  BO -> PM: Approve Plan
end

' Step 4.4: Prepare Re-Validation
DS -> DS: Collect updated data & configure tests
OPS -> DS: Provide environment resources
SC -> DS: Approve data usage for privacy
DS -> QA: Verify test readiness

' Step 4.5: Execute Re-Validation
DS -> DS: Run re-validation tests (metrics/bias/etc.)
DS -> QA: Provide test results
QA -> QA: Log results, track any issues

' Step 4.6: Evaluate Outcomes
DS -> QA: Share results
QA -> BO: Summarize pass/fail
alt Criteria Met
  BO -> QA: Sign off updated model
  alt Ethical Concern
    IRB -> QA: Ethical compliance sign-off
  end
else Criteria Not Met
  note over DS,QA: Root cause analysis, re-train or revert
end

' Step 4.7: Production Deployment
QA -> OPS: Authorize deployment
OPS -> OPS: Deploy re-validated model
DS -> OPS: Final verification in production
SC -> OPS: Confirm no new compliance issues

' Step 4.8: Documentation and Lessons Learned
DS -> DS: Finalize Re-Validation Report
PM -> DS: Organize lessons-learned meeting
DS -> QA: Archive artifacts
alt If IRB was involved
  IRB -> IRB: Log ethical/regulatory outcomes
end
