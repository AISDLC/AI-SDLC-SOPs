title SOP-1002-01-AI: Capacity Management Process

' Participants
participant "Project Manager" as PM
participant "Capacity Manager" as CM
participant "AI Development Lead" as AI
participant "AI-IRB Liaison" as IRB
participant "Quality Assurance (QA)" as QA
participant "Operations Team" as OPS
participant "Product Owner / Sponsor" as SPONSOR

' 1. Capacity Planning Initiation
PM -> CM: "Notify about new or changed scope"
CM -> AI: "Request AI workload & performance data"
AI -> CM: "Provide usage forecast,\ndata growth, concurrency"
CM -> IRB: "Check if AI-IRB review is needed"
alt Large-scale or high-risk change
    IRB -> IRB: "AI-IRB Review (ethical/safety concerns)"
    IRB -> CM: "Approve or modify plan"
else No AI-IRB approval needed
    note right of CM
      Proceed normally
    end note
end

' 2. Capacity Requirements Definition
CM -> OPS: "Gather current infra usage,\nconstraints"
OPS -> CM: "Provide thresholds,\ndeployment/DC limits"
CM -> SPONSOR: "Confirm cost/time constraints"
SPONSOR -> CM: "Approve capacity direction\n& budget"

' 3. Capacity Plan Development
CM -> CM: "Compile capacity plan\n(Forecast, cost, timeline)"
CM -> OPS: "Review feasibility,\nprocurement lead times"
CM -> AI: "Align with AI model\nscaling requirements"
CM -> PM: "Merge tasks into project plan"

' 4. Implementation
PM -> OPS: "Authorize capacity expansions"
OPS -> OPS: "Provision hardware/cloud,\nset up environment"
OPS -> QA: "Environment ready for verification"
QA -> QA: "Execute load/stress,\nperformance checks"
QA -> CM: "Any issues or defects?"
alt Capacity issues found
    QA -> OPS: "Reconfigure or add resources"
    OPS -> QA: "Updated environment"
    QA -> QA: "Retest"
else No issues
    note right of QA
      Ready for operation
    end note
end

' 5. Ongoing Monitoring & Scaling
OPS -> CM: "Provide continuous usage data"
CM -> OPS: "Set alert thresholds"
OPS -> OPS: "Monitor usage/performance"
OPS -> CM: "Alert if usage spike or threshold exceeded"
alt Urgent expansion needed
    CM -> SPONSOR: "Request immediate approval/funding"
    note right
      Potential retroactive AI-IRB if high-risk
    end note
else Normal operation
    note right of OPS
      Continue monitoring
    end note
end

' 6. Post-Implementation Review
PM -> CM: "Schedule retrospective"
note over PM,CM
  Gather lessons learned,
  update future capacity approach
end note
