' Define participants (avoid vertical-bar notation)
participant "Site Monitoring Lead" as SML
participant "Technical Support" as TechSup
participant "Incident Manager" as IM
participant "Operations Engineer" as OE
participant "AI Dev Team" as AIDev
participant "Security/Compliance" as SC
participant "Quality Assurance" as QA
participant "AI-IRB Liaison" as IRB

' 1. Monitoring Setup and Thresholds
SML -> SML: Configure dashboards/alerts\n(Performance, usage, anomaly thresholds)

' 2. Detect Incident
TechSup -> SML: Report user complaint or system alert
SML -> IM: Log initial incident details\n(Assign provisional severity)

' 3. Potential Ethical Concerns?
alt Possibly Ethical/Regulatory Concern
    SML -> IRB: Notify potential AI ethics/regulatory breach
else No immediate IRB concern
    note over SML: Skip IRB step
end

' 4. Incident Triage and Severity
IM -> IM: Determine final severity (P0, P1, P2)
IM -> OE: Notify if infrastructure or network problem
IM -> AIDev: Notify if code/model bug
IM -> SC: Notify if data privacy or security concern

' 5. Investigation and Escalation
alt Infrastructure Root Cause
    OE -> SML: Provide environment logs / config updates
    OE -> IM: Summarize findings
else Model/Code Bug
    AIDev -> AIDev: Replicate scenario in dev environment
    AIDev -> IM: Summarize findings
else Security/Privacy
    SC -> SC: Analyze logs for intrusion / data leakage
    SC -> IM: Summarize findings
end

' 6. Ethical Overlap?
alt AI Model Bias or Unethical Behavior
    IM -> IRB: Engage IRB for review
end

' 7. Resolution
alt Fix Required
    IM -> AIDev: Implement fix or patch
    AIDev -> QA: Provide updated code
    QA -> QA: Validate fix in staging environment
    QA -> IM: Confirm resolution
else No immediate fix
    note over IM: Provide workaround or monitoring
end

' 8. Deploy Fix to Production
IM -> SML: Authorize final fix deployment
SML -> OE: Deploy code to production environment
OE -> QA: Notify QA for final verification
QA -> IM: Approve production environment status

' 9. Closure
IM -> IM: Update incident log to "Resolved/Closed"
IM -> TechSup: Communicate resolution to end users or external clients

' 10. Post-Incident Review
IM -> IM: Schedule lessons learned session
IM -> IRB: If involved, finalize ethical sign-off
IM -> SML: Evaluate monitoring changes
IM -> QA: Document improvement actions
