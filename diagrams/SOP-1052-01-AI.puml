' === 1. Model Lifecycle Planning ===
ProdMgt -> DataSci: Define model objectives and constraints
DataSci -> IRBLiaison: Request AI-IRB compliance guidance
IRBLiaison -> IRBLiaison: Prepare IRB submission packet
IRBLiaison -> Sponsor: Present compliance needs & budget
Sponsor -> Sponsor: Approve resources and schedule

' === 2. AI-IRB Approval Phase ===
DataSci -> IRBLiaison: Submit design documents
alt AI-IRB major changes required
    IRBLiaison -> DataSci: Request modifications
    DataSci -> DataSci: Revise model design
    DataSci -> IRBLiaison: Resubmit updated design
else AI-IRB approved
    IRBLiaison -> DataSci: IRB approval granted
end

' === 3. QA Review and Operations Setup ===
QA -> DataSci: Validate model readiness
QA -> DevTeam: Validate integration plan
DevTeam -> Ops: Confirm environment needs
Ops -> Ops: Provision staging/production resources

' === 4. Deployment and Verification ===
DevTeam -> Ops: Deploy AI model to production
Ops -> QA: Notify readiness for final checks
QA -> DataSci: Monitor initial performance metrics
alt Model meets acceptance criteria
    DataSci -> TechSupport: Provide support guidelines
    TechSupport -> TechSupport: Prepare helpdesk materials
else Model does NOT meet acceptance
    DataSci -> DevTeam: Retrain or fix issues
    DevTeam -> Ops: Deploy revised version
end

' === 5. Post-Deployment Monitoring and Retraining ===
QA -> DataSci: Track ongoing performance, detect drift
DataSci -> IRBLiaison: Consult if changes require IRB re-review
alt Performance decays beyond threshold
    DataSci -> Sponsor: Propose retraining or new model
    IRBLiaison -> IRBLiaison: Check compliance for new changes
    DevTeam -> Ops: Deploy updated model
else Performance remains stable
    QA -> QA: Continue routine monitoring
end

' === 6. Lessons Learned and Review ===
TechSupport -> QA: Provide incident trends
QA -> ProdMgt: Summarize post-implementation findings
ProdMgt -> Sponsor: Present final Post Implementation Review
