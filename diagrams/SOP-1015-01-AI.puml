participant "Data Scientist" as DataSci
participant "MLOps/Operations" as MLOps
participant "Quality Assurance" as QA
participant "Receiving Organization" as RecvOrg

' 1. PM initiates knowledge transfer scheduling
PM -> DevTeam: Initiate KT request & timeline
PM -> QA: Confirm readiness for doc review
PM -> AIIRB: Verify IRB obligations

' 2. DevTeam and DataSci prepare Handover Package
DevTeam -> DataSci: Coordinate final code & model docs
DataSci -> DevTeam: Provide data lineage & feature catalog
DevTeam -> QA: Submit draft Handover Package

' 3. QA reviews content for completeness and correctness
QA -> DevTeam: Provide feedback on missing/unclear items
DevTeam -> DataSci: Clarify data or model queries if needed
DevTeam -> QA: Resubmit updated documentation

' 4. MLOps environment notes added
QA -> MLOps: Request environment details for handover
MLOps -> DevTeam: Provide pipeline & operational docs

' 5. AIIRB compliance check
QA -> AIIRB: Validate AI-IRB compliance docs
alt IRB compliance

else IRB not compliant
    AIIRB -> QA: Request additional clarifications
    QA -> DevTeam: Clarify or remediate compliance issues
    DevTeam -> AIIRB: Resubmit compliance docs
    AIIRB -> QA: Approved
end

' 6. PM schedules formal knowledge transfer
PM -> RecvOrg: Invite to KT workshops
RecvOrg -> PM: Confirm schedule availability

' 7. Conduct formal KT sessions
group KT Session 1: Architecture & Code
    DevTeam -> RecvOrg: Present architecture, code structure
end
group KT Session 2: Model & Data
    DataSci -> RecvOrg: Demonstrate training pipeline, data usage
end
group KT Session 3: Compliance/Ethics
    AIIRB -> RecvOrg: Summarize compliance constraints & risk
end

' 8. Q&A & open issues
RecvOrg -> DevTeam: Raise open questions
DevTeam -> RecvOrg: Provide clarifications

' 9. Decision: Are there unresolved issues?
alt Issues remain
    DevTeam -> RecvOrg: Resolve all open items
    QA -> DevTeam: Verify resolution
else No issues
    RecvOrg -> PM: Acknowledge readiness
end

' 10. Final sign-off
QA -> RecvOrg: Request acceptance sign-off
